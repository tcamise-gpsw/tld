`tld` provides a complete software architecture management platform that bundles a high-performance Go backend with an interactive React frontend into a single, standalone binary. Includes a CLI to enable managing diagrams from the shell or in CI. 

Designed for local-first development and private self-hosting, `tld` allows teams to visualize, document, and manage their system architecture using a combination of a rich web UI and "Diagrams as Code" workflows.

## Key Features

- **Full-Featured Web UI**: A React frontend designed, polished and optimized to handle complex architectures while attempting to intelligently show and hide details.
- **Git diff visualization**: Seamlessly sync and visualize the changes you or your agent are making live in diagram form. Inspect the dependencies and intervene when necessary.
- **Bi-directional Sync**: Seamlessly sync changes between your local YAML files, the self-hosted web UI, and the cloud version at tlDiagram.com.
- **Standalone Distribution**: A single, dependency-free binary containing both the server and the web application.
- **CLI built that speaks agent**: Use the [agent skill](./skills/create-diagram/SKILL.md) and teach your agent how to create a diagram of your codebase with the exact detail level you need. You can prompt your agent to add/remove details as needed. 
Here are some examples that were generated using the agent skill.

- **Diagrams as Code**: A Git-like workflow (`plan`/`apply`) to manage architectural evolution alongside your source code.
- **Automated Codebase Analysis**: (Preview) Built-in tree-sitter integration to automatically discover architecture components in Go, Java, Python, C++, and TypeScript (more soon™ (hopefully)).

## Quick Start
### Single line install and start
```bash
curl -LsSf https://tldiagram.com/install.sh | sh -s serve --open
```

Windows:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://tldiagram.com/install.ps1 | iex; tld serve --open"
```

OR

### 1. Install the binary
```bash
curl -LsSf https://tldiagram.com/install.sh | sh
```

Windows:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://tldiagram.com/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### 2. Launch the Web UI
Initialize a workspace and start the local server:
```bash
tld serve
```
Open **`http://localhost:8060`** to start visually mapping your architecture.

---

## Deployment & Self-Hosting

The `tld` binary is designed to be run as a persistent service in your infrastructure or as a local development tool.

### Local Development
Run `tld serve` in any directory to start a local instance that uses your current folder for storage. 

### Server Deployment
1. Provide a persistent volume for the `.tld/` directory (where YAMLs and the SQLite cache are stored).
2. Set `TLD_ADDR=0.0.0.0` and `PORT=8060`.

### Configuration
Various configuration options are available in `~/.config/tldiagram/tld.yaml`

---

## The tlDiagram Workflow

`tld` bridges the gap between manual diagramming and automated documentation.

1. **Visualize**: Use `tld serve` to open the interactive UI. Drag, drop, and connect components.
2. **Automate**: Run `tld analyze` to scan your repository. It will suggest new elements and connectors based on your actual source code.
3. **Commit**: Save your changes. All UI edits are persisted to `elements.yaml` and `connectors.yaml`. Commit these to Git to version your architecture.

---

- **Backend**: Go 1.26+ 
  - *CLI*: Cobra
  - *API*: Connect RPC (gRPC compatible)
  - *Analysis*: Tree-sitter
  - *Database*: Embedded SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`)
- **Frontend**: React 18 & TypeScript
  - *Visualization*: ReactFlow, ElkJS (auto-layout), D3-force
  - *UI Components*: Chakra UI
- **Build System**: GoReleaser (for cross-platform standalone binaries)

---

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute to `tld` or build it from source:

  1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mertcikla/tld.git
   cd tld
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make frontend-deps
   ```

3. **Development Mode (Hot Reloading)**:
   This starts the Vite dev server for the frontend and the Air reloader for the Go backend.
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

4. **Production Build**:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

## Workspace Structure

- `.tld.yaml`: Project settings and exclusions.
- `elements.yaml`: Definitions for all components and their placements.
- `connectors.yaml`: Connection and relationship definitions.
- `.tld.lock`: Tracks sync state and versioning.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TLD_ADDR` | Host address to bind the server. | `127.0.0.1` |
| `PORT` | Port for the web UI and API. | `8060` |
| `TLD_API_KEY` | API key for cloud synchronization. | - |

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"Server already running"**: Run `tld stop` to clear the PID file and shut down the background process.
- **UI not reflecting YAML changes**: Restart the server or ensure `tld serve` is running in the correct directory.
- **Language support**: If a language isn't detected, ensure the parser is registered in `internal/analyzer`.
